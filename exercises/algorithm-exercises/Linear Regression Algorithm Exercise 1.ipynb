    "   ## An introduction to Linear Regression\n",
    " \n",
    " Linear Regression is one the easiest algorithms to understand use in statistics and machine learning. For those of us very familiar with the field of Statitics, Linear Regression may ring a bell. Machine learning(ML) is for a machine to learn from experience. For the machine to find a relationship between a bunch of inputs and their corresponding outputs. So it is not surprising to find Linear Regression being stolen from Statistics and applied in ML since it a linear approach to model the relationshp between an input/inputs and an output/outputs.
